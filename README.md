This is the code for an LDS gospel study app which correlates scriptural cross-references, Conference talks, indexes to the standard works, and other sources into a connected knowledge graph that can be searched and traversed to aid in diving deep into specific topics.

Typical usage patterns are:

- Lookup any scripture or conference talk you want and just read normally
- While reading, at any time select a verse and "add to search" to find all cross-references to that verse and times it has been quoted in conference
- Start with a topical guide search like "repentance" and that will give you a big list of all the TG / Index / Bible Dictionary results
- More advanced, you can combine several search terms at once to find, for example, correspondences of "Dallin H. Oaks" and "squirrel" (and find out that David B. Haight quoted the same squirrel story in 1992)
